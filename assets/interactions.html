We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Everyone loved it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Yum!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     124416 |      120345 | 2011-08-06 |        0 | Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears. |
| 2000192946 |      120345 | 2015-05-10 |        2 | This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!                                                                                                                            |</p>
